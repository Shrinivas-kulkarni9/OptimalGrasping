# Abstract
This project institutes a novel idea to tackle the problem of space debris removal, specifically focusing on debris that is large in size, and can interfere with functional satellites in space. Grasping the debris by a hand and maneuvering it as needed, possibly towards a graveyard orbit seems intuitive, but grasping requires a robotic hand. Since a hand is nearly impossible to deploy in space which can grasp objects, we move towards multiple finger-like objects which are not physically connected by a palm to replicate our hand. Since these are not physically connected, controlling them individually to make them work together again is infeasible, and we finally move towards multi-agent systems. The idea is to use multiple cooperative agents which interact with each other, and use them to perform the task of grasping and maneuvering the debris as desired.
